## About

MeteorMate was inspired by a personal need for accurate and reliable weather information. Growing up in a region with unpredictable weather, I often found myself caught off guard by sudden changes in weather conditions. This led me to develop MeteorMate, a tool that provides timely and precise weather updates to help others stay prepared.

The development of MeteorMate began in early 2023 as a portfolio project for Holberton School, where I am currently studying software development. This project allowed me to apply the skills I learned in the classroom to solve a real-world problem, and it has been a rewarding journey.
